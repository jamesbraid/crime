# Ghidra tooling

Everything that runs inside Ghidra lives here. A component has its own
acceptance test, run from the repository root inside the Ghidra image with
`root/` populated. No component has landed yet; the empty directories (each
holds a `.gitkeep`) fix the layout.

```
ghidra/
  processors/<name>/   one Ghidra processor extension per directory
                       (extension.properties, data/languages/*.slaspec,
                       tests/, tools/)
  import/<name>/       loader and import scripts for firmware images
  types/<name>/        data-type scripts
  scripts/             the shared IRIX scripts (IrixGp, IrixJumpTables,
                       FindWindowStores, MarkVolatileWindows, ...), byte-identical across workspaces
```

## Build and run

Run a component's `tests/run-ghidra.sh` in the Ghidra image, then its
`tests/check.py` on the dump directory it writes:

```sh
re-run --workspace . --ghidra -- ghidra/processors/NAME/tests/run-ghidra.sh .cache/NAME
re-run --workspace . -- python3 ghidra/processors/NAME/tests/check.py .cache/NAME
```

(`re-run` mounts the workspace at `/work`, the Ghidra image with `--ghidra` and
the toolchain image without.)

## Decompiled C as JSON, typed structures and function similarity

`re-run --ghidra-export OBJECT` runs Ghidra over one object under `root/` and
writes the result outside the workspace, printing where. It writes nothing into
the repository, so there is nothing to commit by accident.

```sh
# decompiled C per function, as JSON with the decompiler's warnings
re-run --workspace . --ghidra-export root/usr/gfx/arch/IP32CRM32/libGLcore.so \
    --decompile-symbol NAME --decompile-symbol 'prefix_*' --decompile-symbol @0xADDRESS
# the same, with named structure fields
re-run --workspace . --ghidra-export root/usr/gfx/arch/IP32CRM32/libGLcore.so \
    --decompile-symbol NAME --types ghidra/types/context.types.json
# every function, or a list file (one name, glob or @address per line)
re-run --workspace . --ghidra-export OBJECT --decompile-all
re-run --workspace . --ghidra-export OBJECT --decompile-list names.txt
# function similarity: one object per run, each matched against those before it
re-run --workspace . --ghidra-export OBJECT --bsim-db libglcore --bsim-label family-host-abi
```

`--types` takes a JSON file kept in the repository, with `structs`
(`name`, `size`, `fields` of `offset`, `name`, `type`, optional `comment`),
`functions` (`match`: a name, a glob or `@0xADDRESS`; `params` with `type` and
`name`; optional `returns`) and optional `globals` (`address`, `type`, `name`).
Types are `u8 s8 u16 s16 u32 s32 u64 s64 f32 f64`, a struct name, a trailing `*`
or `[N]`. Set `pointer_bytes` (4 for o32 and N32, 8 for 64-bit): a spec for one
pointer width is skipped on the other, since the offsets differ. Only fields
with a source belong in a spec; an unnamed gap stays `field_0x..` in the output.

Decompiler output and similarity scores are navigation, not evidence. The decompiler folds stores,
misses switches and invents parameters; a typed field name only says that a
definition was applied; BSim says two bodies look alike and does not say they are
the same routine, and it cannot say anything about small routines (under about 128 bytes).
A committed claim still rests on the disassembly and the fact sheets. Quote the
instruction, not the C.
